## TalkingData Mobile User Demographics Visualization

### Description:

Python & JavaScript Data Visualization Web Application based on Kaggle's TalkingData Mobile User Demographics dataset. This project was heavily based on the tutorial of [Interactive Data Visualization of Geospatial Data using D3.js, DC.js, Leaflet.js and Python](http://adilmoujahid.com//posts/2016/08/interactive-data-visualization-geospatial-d3-dc-leaflet-python/) by Adil Moujahid. Thanks a lot.

### Dependencies

I updated some JavaScript libraries to the current version and updated some code accordingly. DC.JS depends on D3.JS 3.X version not on 4.X version.

```Python 2.7```, Libraries: ```Pandas```, ```Flask```, ```Shapely```
```JavaScript``` Libraries: ```D3.js 3.X```, ```DC.jS```, ```Crossfilter.js```, ```D3-Queue.js```, ```Underscore.js```, ```Leaflet.js```, ```jQuery.js```, ```Bootstrap.js```
